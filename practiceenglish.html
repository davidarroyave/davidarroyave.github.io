<div class="panel">
    <b>Date:</b> <p>August 4th/2023</p>
    <b>Grade:</b> <p>CLEI 5-1 & 6-1</p>
    <b>Subject:</b> <p>English</p>
    <b>Schedule:</b> <p>18:30 - 21:30</p>
    <b>Topic:</b> <p>Verb To-be</p>
    <b>Goal Objective:</b> <p> Review of Verb To-Be</p>
    <b>Class Description:</b> <p>Apprentice teacher introduction to the class. Verb to-be review with pronouns and sentences. Students wrote down the accurate pronunciation of the pronouns and topic including some sentences with it.</p>
    <b>Pedagogical Reflection:</b> <p>A teacher needs to be prepared to embrace new challenges. It was a significant experience having to help those students for ther very first time to understand a topic but more than studying it is the valuable thing that is inner them. My pedagogical reflection is always be you and give your best, don't take personal with student, as it's stated by Ralph W Tyler on Basic Principles of curriculum and instruction, referring to curriculum design, instructional planing and learning experiences.<b><i> <br> Tyler, R. W. (1949). Basic principles of curriculum and instruction. University of Chicago Press.</i></b> </p>

    <b>Schedule:</b> <p>18:30 - 21:30</p>
    <b>Topic:</b> <p>Don't & Doesn't - Furnite household objects</p>
    <b>Goal Objective:</b> <p> Don't and Doesn't use for singular and plural - Recognition of household objects with their right names in English. </p>
    <b>Class Description:</b> <p>Doesn't/Don't exercises, deeper explanation and differentiation between <b>verb to-be, do and does</b> with their negative. - Spelling house objects words and classroom interaction making them write the words in the board. Finally, They drew a house map with the elements on it.</p>
    <b>Pedagogical Reflection:</b> <p>Group responded attentive to the class, students have some lack on vocabulary and they are just starting with the use of English, for that reason it is important to structure adecquate learning experiences, because with this, they will be more engaged to the class and will be able to achieve the goals.

    <b>Grade:</b> <p>CLEI 5-1 & 6-1</p>
    <b>Subject:</b> <p>English</p>
    <b>Schedule:</b> <p>18:30 - 21:30</p>
    <b>Topic:</b> <p>Simple past and verb to-be</p>
    <b>Goal Objective:</b> <p> Past simple verbs review + Understanding Verb To-Be</p>
    <b>Class Description:</b> <p>Review of the simple past with some exercises on the board also with a workshop "Fill in the gaps" with the right use of simple past.</p>
    <b>Pedagogical Reflection:</b> <p>Students were attentive to the class, receptive to the workshop and teacher's instructions. However, it called my attention that CLEI - 6-1 missed 9 students and CLEI 5-1 missed 4 students, according to the cooperative teacher those groups are showing difficulties with the attendance, maybe because the classes are on Friday evening. Notwithstanding, this is also an issue, having students not interested or demotivated. According to Balfanz, R.D (2007) it is important to identify possible risk that students are facing, this can jeopardize students performance in school or work. <br> <i><b>Balfanz, R. D., Herzog, L., & Mac Iver, D. J. (2007).

    <b>Subject:</b> <p>English</p>
    <b>Schedule:</b> <p>18:30 - 21:30</p>
    <b>Topic:</b> <p>Review Don't and Doesn't and Household furniture objects</p>
    <b>Goal Objective:</b> <p> Understand the use of "Don't and Doesn't" when singular and plural, likewise when it is related to third person. Understand furniture household objects and their locations.</p>
    <b>Class Description:</b> <p>Match review of "Don't" and "Doesn't" on the board, then a "Fill in the gaps" with the right form of Don't and Doesn't, finally translate the sentences. - Review the furniture household objects using the house locations to identify where the object is located at using "There is" and "There are". Then, with a "word search puzzle activity" they will reinforce the objects knowledge. Finally a pictionary game with those words in which students will have to figure out what is the furniture object drawn. For the next session, the guys can create sentences with them using <b>"There is" "There Are"</b> E.g. "There are" dishes in the kitchen/ "There is" a pillow on the Bed. </p></p>
    <b>Pedagogical Reflection:</b> <p> <b>CLEI 4-1:</b> Students were responsive to the class, however, they show huge lacks of vocabulary being so difficult for them to understand the session. Notwithstanding, they focused on the activity performing accurately and asking when needed. I noticed that some of the students get distracted easily. <br> <b>CLEI 3-1:</b> Students Students behave really good, they took part of the activities proposed, the class was clean, no novelties at all. 
    <br>
    It is important to identify associations, factors that can be affecting students concentrations, those types of distractors affect their learning process as stated by John Medina in his book:  "Brain Rules: 12 Principles for Surviving and Thriving at Work, Home, and School." <br> <i><b>Medina, J.

    <b>Subject:</b> <p>English</p>
    <b>Schedule:</b> <p>18:30 - 21:30</p>
    <b>Topic:</b> <p>Simple Past and Verb to-be</p>
    <b>Goal Objective:</b> <p> Understanding the Simple past and verb To-be</p>
    <b>Class Description:</b> <p>Introduction about the topic, brief review of regular and irregular verbs, then, "Reach the star game" for both Simple past and Verb to-be. E.g: The flashcards will have some numbers on it, the number taken out will correspond to an exercise to do on the board about the topics.</p>
    <b>Pedagogical Reflection:</b> <p>For CLEI 6-1, the are selected to participate in a project. This project could be related to something for the school that can be used for learning English, it could be a booklet, glossary, pictionary with images and words, comics, music etc. For that reason they will do a survey with things that they like, that way the teacher will have an idea about proposals for the project.
    <br>
   <b>CLEI 6-1</b>  Missed 8 students, only 4 attended to the class. The game (Reach the star) was done with those four students, they performed really well when pulling out the exercises from the flashcard. Students reviewed the topic with no novelties at all, the thing that is matter of concern is that students are missing too much the class sessions.
   <b>CLEI 5-1</b> Only 4 students attended to the class, the activity was performed with them likewise. They are showing a positive development about learning of the topic given. Thus, one of the topics that call my attention is the drop out in education, therefore, it is important to keep an eye of those red flags that alert about the student disengagement as mentioned by Balfanz, R. D., Herzog, L., & Mac Iver, D. J. (2007). <br> <i><b>Balfanz, R. D., Herzog, L., & Mac Iver, D. J. (2007).

        The results show that the most popular content of interest is those related to dramatizations and multimedia, including music and video, whose preferred themes are adventure, science fiction and also real life stories.
        On the other hand, it is evident that there is a similarity in preference for individual work and work in small groups of 2 or 3 students. Emphasizing that there is a predilection for a deliverable, be it a poster or a visual object such as a booklet or brochure.

    <b>CLEI 3-1</b>  They were responsive to the class, with participation and understanding the topic given.
    <b>CLEI 4-1</b> Students had a great behavior, they were attentive to the class, some of them show lazinees when having to translate information using their devices.
    <br>
    Some students due to association are presenting difficulties of attention, therefore, it is significant to stand out that for some of them due to their psychological condition, engagement is not exactly what they need, some of them need something to work on at that particular moment, this is when professor Wiggings mentioned the importance of designing learning experiences, thus, step by step the group will be performing more engagement activities for them to gain experience. <br> <i><b>Wiggins, G., & McTighe, J.

    <b>CLEI 5-1</b> Had a great participation, 2 students missed the class, nonetheless, they had a positive approach to the puzzle activity showing interest and concentration.
    <br>

    <b>Subject:</b> <p>English</p>
    <b>Schedule:</b> <p>18:30 - 21:30</p>
    <b>Topic:</b> <p>How Many - Introduction of prepositions of place</p>
    <b>Goal Objective:</b> <p> Introduce the topic of "how many" with a workshop, finish the furniture household objects topic.</p>
    <b>Class Description:</b> <p>Students will identify the count of tangible objects on the worshop given, they will see some sets on it to figure out and some of them to draw, paint or write according the total of objects listed there. For the written part they will use "there is and there are" and Finish the furniture household objects with a workshop, name the picture in english. Then, introduce the topic of prepositions of place (on, above, below, in, between) using there is and there are. </p>
    <b>Pedagogical Reflection:</b> <p> <b>CLEI 4-1</b> Students behave really well, they worked on the proposed workshop learning the critical concepts about "How Many" when referring to countable things.
    <b>CLEI 3-1</b> Students started the class so distracted, making noise, talking to each other, throwing things, it was difficult to recover their attention, the teacher had to call the coordinator to bring the order back again. After the coordinator scold on them, they started to behave prudently paying attention t the class and teacher's instructions.
    <br>
    CLEI 3-1 had 1 student misssing, while, CLEI 4-1 had like 5 students missing, so, that way it is really hard because students are getting behind.
    <br>
    Managing students behavior is still a challenge because most of their triggers are comming their own psychological aspects as stated on Glasser, W. (1990). That author believes that students have negative behavior whhen they feel their needs are not fulfilled, so, the teacher needs to create a quality school environment where students feel involved in the activities, but this turn difficult when the school does not have enough resources. Moreover, when students don't want to cooperate because of reluctancy. <br> <i><b>Glasser, W. (1990). The Quality School: Managing Students Without Coercion. HarperCollins.</b></i>

    Identifying some of the aspects that may trigger students to be absent in class could be the factor of working hours during the day, lack of rules and discipline from school principal, maybe because the rules are more flexible for the students, taking into account that is nocturnal modality. Hence, here is where the effective interventions need to take action on.Starting from this scenario, it is important for the institution to be severe with the assistance for those students that hardly ever assit.

Only five students attended the class. <br> 3-1 Students worked in a workshop, selecting the accurate preposition of place. Good Behavior. <br> • The use of technology for teaching is remarkable in education; students have another way to see the information and can be more captivated by the topics. That's when <b>Milton Chen (2010)</b> talks about the role of technology in transforming education as an innovative approach to modern education. It turns out that this is difficult to handle when there are no resources. Nonetheless, This is when teachers need to bring up other ways to teach. <br> <i><b> Chen, M. (2010).

    <b>Pedagogical Reflection:</b> <p> <b>CLEI 4-1:</b>Students responded so well to the activity about some WH questions that they were quiet.<b> <br> CLEI 3-1:</b> Students were talking too much during the class due to a workshop in groups; they had difficulties focusing on the activity. <br><br> I noticed this as a new behavior for the students of CLEI 3-1; they used to be so focused on their responsibilities and, moreover, had positive results. But, when working in groups, they started to talk about other topics and not about the workshop given; thus, bringing up what the authors Balfanz Herzog and Mac Iver (2007) say about student disengagement, I can identify the factor that triggers this behavior as being that they are kind of relaxed because of positive results during the course. They feel they have an advantage based on the average score to succeed in the subject. <br><br>  <b><i>Balfanz, R. D., Herzog, L., & Mac Iver, D. J. (2007).

    <b>Pedagogical Reflection:</b> <p>The students had great behavior and responded well to the activity. I noticed that most of them were so tired when the class started. This factor seems to be coming from an external source. <br>I would like to mention Jane McGonigal (2011) in her book <q>Reality is Broker</q>. She explains how games impact education, identifying that challenges in games motivate students for activities; thus, I consider this a great approach for classroom practices.
