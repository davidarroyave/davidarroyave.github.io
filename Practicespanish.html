<div class="panel">
    <b>Date:</b> <p>August 4th/2023</p>
    <b>Grade:</b> <p>CLEI 5-1 & 6-1</p>
    <b>Subject:</b> <p>English</p>
    <b>Schedule:</b> <p>18:30 - 21:30</p>
    <b>Topic:</b> <p>Verb To-be</p>
    <b>Goal Objective</b> <p> Review of Verb To-Be</p>
    <b>Class Description:</b> <p>Apprentice teacher introduction to the class. Verb to-be review with pronouns and sentences. Students wrote down the accurate pronunciation of the pronouns and topic including some sentences with it.</p>
    <b>Pedagogical Reflection:</b> <p>A teacher needs to be prepared to embrace new challenges. It was a significant experience having to help those students for ther very first time to understand a topic but more than studying it is the valuable thing that is inner them. My pedagogical reflection is always be you and give your best, don't take personal with student, as it's stated by Ralph W Tyler on Basic Principles of curriculum and instruction, referring to curriculum design, instructional planing and learning experiences.<b><i> <br> Tyler, R. W. (1949). Basic principles of curriculum and instruction. University of Chicago Press.</i></b> </p>

    <b>Schedule:</b> <p>18:30 - 21:30</p>
    <b>Topic:</b> <p>Don't & Doesn't - Furnite household objects</p>
    <b>Goal Objective</b> <p> Don't and Doesn't use for singular and plural - Recognition of household objects with their right names in English. </p>
    <b>Class Description:</b> <p>Doesn't/Don't exercises, deeper explanation and differentiation between <b>verb to-be, do and does</b> with their negative. - Spelling house objects words and classroom interaction making them write the words in the board. Finally, They drew a house map with the elements on it.</p>
    <b>Pedagogical Reflection:</b> <p>Group responded attentive to the class, students have some lack on vocabulary and they are just starting with the use of English, for that reason it is important to structure adecquate learning experiences, because with this, they will be more engaged to the class and will be able to achieve the goals.

    <b>Grade:</b> <p>CLEI 5-1 & 6-1</p>
    <b>Subject:</b> <p>English</p>
    <b>Schedule:</b> <p>18:30 - 21:30</p>
    <b>Topic:</b> <p>Simple past and verb to-be</p>
    <b>Goal Objective</b> <p> Past simple verbs review + Understanding Verb To-Be</p>
    <b>Class Description:</b> <p>Review of the simple past with some exercises on the board also with a workshop "Fill in the gaps" with the right use of simple past.</p>
    <b>Pedagogical Reflection:</b> <p>Students were attentive to the class, receptive to the workshop and teacher's instructions. However, it called my attention that CLEI - 6-1 missed 9 students and CLEI 5-1 missed 4 students, according to the cooperative teacher those groups are showing difficulties with the attendance, maybe because the classes are on Friday evening. Notwithstanding, this is also an issue, having students not interested or demotivated. According to Balfanz, R.D (2007) it is important to identify possible risk that students are facing, this can jeopardize students performance in school or work. <br> <i><b>Balfanz, R. D., Herzog, L., & Mac Iver, D. J. (2007).

    <b>Date:</b> <p>August 15th/2023</p>
    <b>Grade:</b> <p>CLEI - 4-1 & 3-1</p>
    <b>Subject:</b> <p>English</p>
    <b>Schedule:</b> <p>18:30 - 21:30</p>
    <b>Topic:</b> <p>Review Don't and Doesn't and Household furniture objects</p>
    <b>Goal Objective</b> <p> Understand the use of "Don't and Doesn't" when singular and plural, likewise when it is related to third person. Understand furniture household objects and their locations.</p>
    <b>Class Description:</b> <p>Match review of "Don't" and "Doesn't" on the board, then a "Fill in the gaps" with the right form of Don't and Doesn't, finally translate the sentences. - Review the furniture household objects using the house locations to identify where the object is located at using "There is" and "There are". Then, with a "word search puzzle activity" they will reinforce the objects knowledge. Finally a pictionary game with those words in which students will have to figure out what is the furniture object drawn. For the next Sesión de Clase, the guys can create sentences with them using <b>"There is" "There Are"</b> E.g. "There are" dishes in the kitchen/ "There is" a pillow on the Bed. </p></p>
    <b>Pedagogical Reflection:</b> <p> <b>CLEI 4-1:</b> Students were responsive to the class, however, they show huge lacks of vocabulary being so difficult for them to understand the Sesión de Clase. Notwithstanding, they focused on the activity performing accurately and asking when needed. I noticed that some of the students get distracted easily. <br> <b>CLEI 3-1:</b> Students Students behave really good, they took part of the activities proposed, the class was clean, no novelties at all. 
    <br>
    It is important to identify associations, factors that can be affecting students concentrations, those types of distractors affect their learning process as stated by John Medina in his book:  "Brain Rules: 12 Principles for Surviving and Thriving at Work, Home, and School." <br> <i><b>Medina, J.

    <b>Schedule:</b> <p>18:30 - 21:30</p>
    <b>Topic:</b> <p>Simple Past and Verb to-be</p>
    <b>Goal Objective</b> <p> Understanding the Simple past and verb To-be</p>
    <b>Class Description:</b> <p>Introduction about the topic, brief review of regular and irregular verbs, then, "Reach the star game" for both Simple past and Verb to-be. E.g: The flashcards will have some numbers on it, the number taken out will correspond to an exercise to do on the board about the topics.</p>
    <b>Pedagogical Reflection:</b> <p>For CLEI 6-1, the are selected to participate in a project. This project could be related to something for the school that can be used for learning English, it could be a booklet, glossary, pictionary with images and words, comics, music etc. For that reason they will do a survey with things that they like, that way the teacher will have an idea about proposals for the project.
    <br>
   <b>CLEI 6-1</b>  Missed 8 students, only 4 attended to the class. The game (Reach the star) was done with those four students, they performed really well when pulling out the exercises from the flashcard. Students reviewed the topic with no novelties at all, the thing that is matter of concern is that students are missing too much the class Sesión de Clases.
   <b>CLEI 5-1</b> Only 4 students attended to the class, the activity was performed with them likewise. They are showing a positive development about learning of the topic given. Thus, one of the topics that call my attention is the drop out in education, therefore, it is important to keep an eye of those red flags that alert about the student disengagement as mentioned by Balfanz, R. D., Herzog, L., & Mac Iver, D. J. (2007). <br> <i><b>Balfanz, R. D., Herzog, L., & Mac Iver, D. J. (2007).

    <b>Class Description:</b> <p>With the activities donde during the Sesión de Clases regarding the right use of "Don't and Doesn't" students will work on a workshop assesment related to fill in the gaps correctly using the negative of Do and Does, moreover, they will translate the text to learn vocabulary. </p>
    <b>Pedagogical Reflection:</b> <p>
    <b>CLEI 3-1</b>  They were responsive to the class, with participation and understanding the topic given.
    <b>CLEI 4-1</b> Students had a great behavior, they were attentive to the class, some of them show lazinees when having to translate information using their devices.
    <br>
    Some students due to association are presenting difficulties of attention, therefore, it is significant to stand out that for some of them due to their psychological condition, engagement is not exactly what they need, some of them need something to work on at that particular moment, this is when professor Wiggings mentioned the importance of designing learning experiences, thus, step by step the group will be performing more engagement activities for them to gain experience. <br> <i><b>Wiggins, G., & McTighe, J.

    <br>

    CLEI 3-1 had 1 student misssing, while, CLEI 4-1 had like 5 students missing, so, that way it is really hard because students are getting behind.
    <br>
    Managing students behavior is still a challenge because most of their triggers are comming their own psychological aspects as stated on Glasser, W. (1990). That author believes that students have negative behavior whhen they feel their needs are not fulfilled, so, the teacher needs to create a quality school environment where students feel involved in the activities, but this turn difficult when the school does not have enough resources. Moreover, when students don't want to cooperate because of reluctancy. <br> <i><b>Glasser, W. (1990). The Quality School: Managing Students Without Coercion. HarperCollins.</b></i>

    Identifying some of the aspects that may trigger students to be absent in class could be the factor of working hours during the day, lack of rules and discipline from school principal, maybe because the rules are more flexible for the students, taking into account that is nocturnal modality. Hence, here is where the effective interventions need to take action on.Starting from this scenario, it is important for the institution to be severe with the assistance for those students that hardly ever assit.

But, when working in groups, they started to talk about other topics and not about the workshop given; thus, bringing up what the authors Balfanz Herzog and Mac Iver (2007) say about student disengagement, I can identify the factor that triggers this behavior as being that they are kind of relaxed because of positive results during the course. They feel they have an advantage based on the average score to succeed in the subject. <br><br>  <b><i>Balfanz, R. D., Herzog, L., & Mac Iver, D. J. (2007).
